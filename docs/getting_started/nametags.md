## Hiding / showing names

Do you need npc's name above head to be hidden?
You have the following options

* add Taterzen to a team and set a nametag visibility team rule
* use a built-in command (this won't support changing [poses](./poses.md))
    ```
    /npc edit tags showCustomName false
    ```
