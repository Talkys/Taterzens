# Taterzen docs

Built with `mkdocs-material`.

As I'm developing the mod, ~~I'm often lazy and don't care about docs~~ configurations, commands etc.
are self-understandable to me. But as a user, you might feel lost in the Taterzen command tree.


Do you feel like some parts of docs can be improved? Rephrased? Are there annoying typos?

Feel free to fork the project and improve the docs.
[Install mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

Submit a PR and let everyone have
a better experience understanding the mod.

Thank you so much!
