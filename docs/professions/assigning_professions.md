# Assigning professions (in-game)

---


## Giving Taterzen a profession
```
/npc edit professions add <profession id>
```
Profession IDs will be automatically generated for each profession
that was registered by mod developers. By default, there are no
profession mods available, but this might change in future :).

## Listing current professions
```
/npc edit professions list
```
This will print all the professions of Taterzen to chat.
You can click on the <span style="color:red">X</span> to remove profession from Taterzen.

## Removing professions
As said above, you can click on the <span style="color:red">X</span> next to the profession
ID to remove it. But you can also use
```
/npc edit professions remove <profession id>
```
